# This is the GitHub repository for Daniel Kudley's Comp Sci Special Topics project

# What the project is:
## This project will attempt to use the Spotify Web API to create a website that can utilize the various features of the API to give users information about the songs they listen to and give them reccomendations for new artists
## So far, the code consists of a small placeholder website and some python code that, when given a spotify link to a song, will return the name of the song and artist that created it.

# Testing:
## Website: https://whyolent.github.io/SWAG
### Currently the website just has 2 empty pages, just switch between them a few times if you feel like it not much to see there
## Python: https://replit.com/@WhyolentDK/SWAG#main.py
### Open the link and select the green run button
### Wait for the program to install the needed packages until you see a prompt to enter a Spotify link
### Copy the link to any song on Spotify by going to open.spotify.com, right-clicking a song, and selecting "Copy Song Link" under the "Share" menu
### Paste the link into the program by right-clicking the window and selecting paste (using ctrl+v doesn't work) and hit enter
### The program should respond with a message saying "This is a link to [song name] by [artist name]!"
